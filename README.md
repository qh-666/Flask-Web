# Flask-Web for Object-Detection

The website we developed allows users to register with username and password, and then login
with the same user credentials. Once logged in, users can upload photos on which openCV is
automatically applied for object detection. Rectangles will be drawn around detected objects
along with their corresponding category labels. Thumbnails of uploaded photos are displayed
within the gallery. By clicking on the thumbnail, original image as well as the the modied image
with detected objects will be presented.
